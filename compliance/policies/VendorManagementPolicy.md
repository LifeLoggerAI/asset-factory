## Asset Factory – Vendor Management Policy v1.0

### 1. Purpose

To establish a process for identifying, evaluating, and managing third-party vendors and service providers. This ensures that our partners meet Asset Factory's security, compliance, and operational standards.

### 2. Vendor Assessment

Before engaging with a new vendor, a risk assessment will be performed. The assessment will consider:
- The vendor's security and compliance posture (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001 certifications).
- The nature and sensitivity of the data that will be accessed or processed by the vendor.
- The vendor's service level agreements (SLAs) for uptime and support.

### 3. Critical Vendors

A list of critical vendors will be maintained. A vendor is considered critical if their services are essential to the operation of the Asset Factory platform. Our current critical vendors include:

- **Google Cloud Platform (Firebase):** For hosting, database, functions, and storage.
- **[Your Model Provider]:** For core AI generation capabilities.
- **[Your Billing Provider]:** For payment processing.

### 4. Vendor Review

- All critical vendors will be reviewed on an annual basis.
- The review will ensure that the vendor continues to meet our security and compliance requirements.
- Any changes to a vendor's service or compliance status will be documented.

### 5. Contractual Requirements

All vendor contracts must include clauses that address:
- Confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- Security incident notification requirements.
- The right to audit.
