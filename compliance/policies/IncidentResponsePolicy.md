## Asset Factory – Incident Response Plan v1.0

### 1. Purpose

To establish a structured and effective response to security incidents, ensuring timely containment, investigation, and resolution to protect Asset Factory systems, customer data, and brand reputation.

### 2. Incident Response Phases

The incident response lifecycle is broken into five distinct phases:

1.  **Identification:** Detecting and reporting a potential security incident. Incidents can be identified through automated monitoring alerts, internal reports, or external notifications.
2.  **Containment:** Taking immediate action to limit the scope and impact of the incident. This may involve isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, or blocking malicious IP addresses.
3.  **Eradication:** Investigating the root cause of the incident and removing the threat from the environment.
4.  **Recovery:** Restoring systems to normal operation and verifying that they are secure.
5.  **Post-Mortem:** Conducting a post-incident review to document the event, identify lessons learned, and implement improvements to prevent recurrence.

### 3. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander:** The designated lead for coordinating the incident response effort.
- **Technical Lead:** Responsible for the technical investigation and remediation activities.
- **Communications Lead:** Manages all internal and external communications related to the incident.

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Critical Incidents (e.g., data breach, service outage):** Response initiated within 1 hour of detection.
- **High-Severity Incidents (e.g., API key abuse):** Response initiated within 4 hours.
- **Medium-Severity Incidents:** Response initiated within 12 hours.

### 5. Customer Notification

In the event of an incident that impacts customer data or service availability, affected enterprise customers will be notified within 24 hours of confirmation, in accordance with SLA commitments.
