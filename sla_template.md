# Production Service Level Agreement (SLA) Template

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a component of the Master Services Agreement ("MSA") between [Your Company] ("Provider") and [Customer Name] ("Customer") and applies to the services provided by Provider to Customer as described in the MSA.

## 1. Service Commitment

Provider commits to providing a 99.5% monthly uptime for the Asset Factory API.

## 2. Measurement

Monthly uptime is calculated as:

`(Total minutes in a month - Downtime minutes) / Total minutes in a month * 100`

Downtime is defined as any period of time when the Asset Factory API is unavailable for processing new jobs. Downtime does not include scheduled maintenance, which will be communicated to the Customer at least 48 hours in advance.

## 3. Service Credits

In the event of a failure to meet the monthly uptime commitment, Customer will be eligible to receive a service credit as follows:

-   **99.0% to 99.49% uptime:** 10% credit of the monthly fee
-   **95.0% to 98.99% uptime:** 25% credit of the monthly fee
-   **Less than 95.0% uptime:** 50% credit of the monthly fee

Service credits will be applied to the Customer's next invoice. To receive a service credit, the Customer must submit a request to the Provider within 30 days of the end of the month in which the downtime occurred.

## 4. Exclusions

This SLA does not apply to any performance or availability issues:

-   Caused by factors outside of Provider's reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Provider's hosting provider.
-   That result from Customer's equipment, software, or other technology and/or third-party equipment, software, or other technology (other than third-party equipment within Provider's direct control).
-   That result from any actions or inactions of Customer or any third party.
