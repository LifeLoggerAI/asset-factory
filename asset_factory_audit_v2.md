Current status: URAI’s asset‑factory functions as a headless, API‑driven production engine that turns structured prompts into ready‑to‑use media assets—images, videos, audio/voice‑overs, subtitles, storyboards and static graphics. It follows a pipeline model similar to an industrial “AI factory,” transforming inputs through preprocessing, orchestration (routing to specialised models) and post‑processing before export. It is format‑aware (generating CapCut files, PDFs, SRTs, etc.) and is designed to support multiple URAI products.

Completed / live capabilities: The implemented pipeline can produce short‑form, long‑form and reels‑style videos; create static visuals; synthesise voice‑overs; and generate narratives and storyboards. The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability and observability. This aligns with the industrial AI‑factory concept, which emphasises reliable, repeatable production across modalities. These features satisfy the V1 “Stabilise & Name It” goals described in the roadmap.

What’s missing / underpowered: The project currently lacks a clear public contract and input schema: inputs such as story structure, mood, audience type, duration and platform targets are not formally defined, which limits repeatability and external adoption. There is also no deterministic guarantee that “given input X you will get outputs Y and Z,” which is essential for monetisation and SLA commitments. These gaps impede external use and B2B trust.

Not yet implemented (future work): Roadmap items for V1.5 (“Productise”) and V2 (“Monetise & Scale”) remain open. These include building a minimal UI for external users (upload, progress tracking, download), adding presets (e.g. marketing kit, story video), platform toggles, introducing usage‑based pricing and B2B plans, exposing API keys, white‑label exports, and team management features. These additions would move asset‑factory beyond an internal engine into a full product.

Live/deployed/locked: Based on a review of the operational logs, the `asset-factory` project was finalized on February 7, 2026. The log file `FINALIZE_20260207_211631.log` contains the entry "Product is LIVE." The `LOCK.md` file further confirms this, showing a lock date of February 8, 2026, at 00:55:11 UTC. This verifies the project is live and deployed. It should be noted that the finalization log reported completion with warnings, which may warrant a separate review.

**Disaster Recovery Objectives (Added as part of 30-Day Hardening):**
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours. This is the maximum acceptable time for the service to be unavailable following a disaster-level event in our primary region.
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 1 hour. This is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time. All database and storage changes should be replicated to a secondary region within this timeframe.

In summary, asset‑factory is an essential production engine for URAI that is operational today, with a solid core pipeline. Completing the missing input schemas, adding deterministic guarantees and shipping the V1.5/V2 roadmap items are the key next steps to unlock its full value and turn it into a standalone, monetisable product.
